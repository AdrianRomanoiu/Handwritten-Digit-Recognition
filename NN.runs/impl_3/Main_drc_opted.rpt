2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

DPIP-1#1 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP UC/Adr_W0 input UC/Adr_W0/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPIP-1#2 Warning
Input pipelining  
DSP UC/Adr_W0 input UC/Adr_W0/C[47:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-1#1 Warning
PREG Output pipelining  
DSP UC/Adr_W0 output UC/Adr_W0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
Related violations: <none>

DPOP-2#1 Warning
MREG Output pipelining  
DSP UC/Adr_W0 multiplier stage UC/Adr_W0/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
Related violations: <none>

AVAL-4#1 Advisory
enum_USE_DPORT_FALSE_enum_DREG_ADREG_0_connects_CED_CEAD_RSTD_GND  
FP_ADD/U0/i_synth/ADDSUB_OP.ADDSUB/SPEED_OP.DSP.OP/DSP48E1_BODY.NORM_RND/FULL_USAGE_DSP.SHIFT_RND/DSP: DSP48E1 is not using the D port (USE_DPORT = FALSE). For improved power characteristics, set DREG and ADREG to '1', tie CED, CEAD, and RSTD to logic '0'.
Related violations: <none>

AVAL-4#2 Advisory
enum_USE_DPORT_FALSE_enum_DREG_ADREG_0_connects_CED_CEAD_RSTD_GND  
FP_ADD_2/U0/i_synth/ADDSUB_OP.ADDSUB/SPEED_OP.DSP.OP/DSP48E1_BODY.NORM_RND/FULL_USAGE_DSP.SHIFT_RND/DSP: DSP48E1 is not using the D port (USE_DPORT = FALSE). For improved power characteristics, set DREG and ADREG to '1', tie CED, CEAD, and RSTD to logic '0'.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1725#1 Advisory
DSP_Abus_sign_bit_alert  
FP_ADD/U0/i_synth/ADDSUB_OP.ADDSUB/SPEED_OP.DSP.OP/DSP48E1_BODY.ALIGN_ADD/DSP2/DSP: When using the PreAdder and USE_DPORT is TRUE, the A operand should be restricted to 24 bit two's complement (and sign extended) to avoid over/underflow in the pre-add stage.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1725#2 Advisory
DSP_Abus_sign_bit_alert  
FP_ADD_2/U0/i_synth/ADDSUB_OP.ADDSUB/SPEED_OP.DSP.OP/DSP48E1_BODY.ALIGN_ADD/DSP2/DSP: When using the PreAdder and USE_DPORT is TRUE, the A operand should be restricted to 24 bit two's complement (and sign extended) to avoid over/underflow in the pre-add stage.
